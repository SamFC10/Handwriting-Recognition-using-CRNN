# Handwriting Recognition using CRNN
Optical Character Recognition(OCR) utilizes image processing technologies to convert characters/strings on scanned documents into digital forms. It typically performs well in machine-printed fonts. However, it still poses difficult challenges for machines to recognize handwritten characters and names, because of the huge variation in individual writing styles.

## Data
The dataset can be downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/landlord/handwriting-recognition). The data consists of roughly 300k training images and 40k validation and test images. The true labels of each image is present in a csv file.
