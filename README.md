# Handwriting Recognition using CRNN
Optical Character Recognition(OCR) utilizes image processing technologies to convert characters/strings on scanned documents into digital forms. It typically performs well in machine-printed fonts. However, it still poses difficult challenges for machines to recognize handwritten characters and names, because of the huge variation in individual writing styles.
